##How to use it?

My project is very user-friendly. 

In the homepage you can find a navbar with a logo that will always take you to the homepage. 
On the navbar you can find how to make a booking request, how to navigate to the barbers section, the gallery section or even the price section.


##Directory Structure and File Naming

####HTML

-I name the homepage index.html so it can display it when I deploy it on github. 
-Gallery.html because it's a gallery.
-Price.html because it's where you can find the price.

####CSS

I wanted it to be easy to find where I should change so I made 3 css files. style.css, header.css and footer.css.
Every change on the header goes to header.css and every change on the footer goes to the footer.css.
The rest of the body and css goes to style.css.

####images

As you can see I have named the following images after the positioning of the website.

-barber_# if on the cards of the homepage.
-gallery_# comes in the gallery page.
-h/p_parallax, h=homepage and p=pricepage.
-nav_logo goes to the navbar and is the logo of the website.
-slide# are the images from the carousel.

##Credits
In this project I want to give credit to Bootstrap for their amazing frameworks.
I want also to add a special thanks @w3newbie for his amazing tutorial on bootstrap that you can find in youtube.
W3schools has helped alot also in this project, for example of the parallax effect. 
The biggest of thanks will go to Google for every small solution I have found there.
